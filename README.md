📌 Overview

The analysis of medical videos for tasks such as action recognition, anomaly detection, and disease progression monitoring plays a vital role in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Traditional models often struggle with efficiently capturing both spatial and temporal information. This project explores the use of the Mamba architecture for spatiotemporal analysis, leveraging its ability to model long sequences and capture temporal dependencies, providing an efficient and accurate solution for analyzing medical videos.

🏗️ Proposed Model Architecture

The model combines the Mamba architecture with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from individual frames and a temporal module to capture the sequence of changes across frames. This hybrid approach efficiently processes both spatial and temporal information, allowing the model to focus on significant events in the video, enabling accurate analysis for tasks like action recognition, anomaly detection, and disease progression.

🔬 Methodology

Dataset Preprocessing: Extracting frames from medical videos, followed by normalization, augmentation, and conversion into formats suitable for Mamba architecture processing. Temporal sequences are carefully aligned to ensure accurate spatiotemporal representation.

Model Development: Implementing the Mamba architecture combined with CNNs to extract spatial features from individual video frames. These features, along with temporal information, are processed through the Mamba model to capture long-term dependencies and spatiotemporal dynamics in medical videos.

Training & Evaluation: Training the model on medical video datasets for tasks like action recognition, anomaly detection, or disease progression analysis. Performance will be evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, comparing the Mamba-based model to traditional CNN-based models.

Optimization: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of both the CNN and Mamba components to optimize the model's ability to learn and represent spatiotemporal features, ensuring higher accuracy and computational efficiency.
