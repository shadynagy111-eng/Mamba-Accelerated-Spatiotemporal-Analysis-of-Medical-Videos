Dataset Description 

Nerthus: A Bowel Preparation Quality Video Dataset

The Nerthus dataset contains real-world medical videos collected from colonoscopy procedures, specifically to evaluate bowel cleansing quality. Bowel cleansing is essential before colonoscopy because it significantly influences how clearly doctors can detect diseases, such as cancer or inflammation, within the bowel.

Whatâ€™s Inside?
21 medical videos recorded during real colonoscopy procedures.
5,525 frames, manually annotated by experienced medical doctors.
Videos sorted into 4 classes based on cleanliness level, according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS):
Score 0: Colon is not visible due to stool.
Score 1: Partial visibility; residues prevent clear view.
Score 2: Mostly clean; minor residues present.
Score 3: Completely clean colon segment.

Why is it Useful?
Medical assessments of bowel cleansing quality can vary from doctor to doctor. By using this dataset, researchers and developers can create automated systems to objectively and reliably evaluate bowel cleansing, helping doctors make more consistent diagnoses.

Possible use-cases:
1-Training computer vision and machine learning models.
2-Developing automated reporting tools for hospitals.
3-Enhancing consistency and accuracy of colonoscopy reports.
